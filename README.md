# WordPress-Image-Slider-Plugin
I have developed a custom WordPress Image Slider plugin that empowers website owners to create multiple image sliders effortlessly. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface within the WordPress admin dashboard, allowing users to select images from the WordPress media library and generate unique shortcodes for each slider.
